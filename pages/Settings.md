## Graphics
- **Enable shadows**

	Enables shadows. Recommended to restart the game afterwards to prevent graphical glitches from happening.

- **Shadow quality**

	Smooth (prettier) or sharp (faster) shadows.

- **Shadow resolution**

	The resolution the shadows are rendered at. `(native)` means the game's current window size (?).

- **Enable AO**

	Enables Ambient Occlusion which gives objects shading.

- **AO map resolution**

	The resolution at which Ambient Occlusion maps are rendered.

- **Enable bloom**

	Smear vaseline on your screen without the need for vaseline.

- **Vertical sync**

	Synchronises the game's framerate to your monitor's refresh rate. Disabling will unlock the frame limiter and cause unnecessary strain on your hardware, and cause speed issues due to the unlocked framerate generally being pretty high. (Principia is not a demanding game)

- **Gamma correction**

	HDR-like lighting improvements.

## Audio
