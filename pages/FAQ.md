# General

## What is principia-web?
Back in late 2020, ROllerozxa launched a new unofficial community site called principia-web, making it possible to easily share your levels again. It's later expanded into including a forum and this wiki. With the open sourcing principia-web is considered to be the primary community site, with the old community site being provided as an archive playable for those with a recent version of open source Principia.

## What is Principia Discord?
It's the "official" Principia Discord server, an invite can be found in the footer of this site. It was originally started sometime 2017 as an unofficial server, but quickly turned into the main community hub after the official community site shut down. It was originally run by uni(valence) but has been taken over by ROllerozxa after a while of administering it. It is now the primary place for Principia-related chit chat, with even sdac joining it alongside the source code release.

## So Principia is open source now?
Yes, sdac came back and released the source code in August 2022. It is available on GitHub, and is continuing development as an open source project.

## When is Principia coming onto Google Play?
No current plans at the moment. However, the Android version of Principia [is available for F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bithack.principia/), an alternative app store focusing on free and open source software.

## What about Steam?
Potentially.

## What about iOS?
Unlikely to happen anytime in the future. See [#85](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/issues/85).

## What about macOS?
An experimental port is available for macOS, see [the download page](/download#macos). It is very incomplete and needs testing and other assistance from someone who has Apple hardware. Contributions are very welcome.

## What about [Insert platform]?
Pull requests welcome.

## What about [Linux distribution]?
Packaging Principia for your favourite Linux distribution is very welcome. Let us know when you've done it so the package can be added to the downloads page.

## Why does my Antivirus/Windows say Principia is malicious?
Because we do not have the money for a signing certificate (which costs a lot of $$$, recurring per year). Principia is not malware, and the builds available on the [download page](/download) are built from source by [Github Workflows](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/actions).

The Windows installer is generally more likely to throw false positives than the portable version. If you are paranoid then you can download the portable version, extract it and scan the extracted game executable `principia.exe` which should give no results. The portable version can then be configured to become the exact same as an installed version of the game if you wish. See the [[Windows Portable]] page for more information.

## Where are my old levels?
They are available in the [Community Site Archive](https://archive.principia-web.se).

## Who is ROllerozxa?
He is the current Principia project maintainer, he also runs this community site and the Principia Discord server. Prior to the open sourcing he has also done various archival efforts of Principia such as archiving old game versions or old community levels. Despite his nationality and seemingly endless knowledge, he is not or has been part of Bithack, but is a community member going back to the 2013 days. You can read more about him [on his website](https://voxelmanip.se/about/).

## I forgot my password.
Please get into contact with [ROllerozxa](/user/1) and he will generate and send you a password reset link. In the future, there will be email-based password resets using the email address you specified during registration.

## How are level screenshots/thumbnails taken?
Currently every level has one thumbnail, which is taken at the first [[Cam Marker]] (or the last camera position) at publish. The screenshots should be taken automatically on level upload after at most a minute or two.
