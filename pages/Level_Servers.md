In the open source version of Principia, there have been various improvements to decentralise being able to play levels from a community site. The Principia protocol has been expanded to include a domain as well as being able to switch the domain the client connects to by default at runtime.

While the term "community site" is still used to refer to such a site you can play and possibly upload levels to with additional interactivity, the more correct term is a level server.

This page serves to be a comprehensive list of Principia level servers that exist.

## Fully featured servers
These websites contain both a level server as well as additional functionality to log in, upload levels, submit highscores, etc.

You can both play levels from these servers as well as change your game's community host to it by creating a file called `community_host.txt` in your Principia user folder and inputting its domain as the first line of the file.

| Domain           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Minimal servers
These only have the bare minimum implemented to support being able to play and/or edit levels from them.

| Domain                   | Description                                                     |
