The Magnetic Plug is an object that can attract [[Magnetic socket]] objects. When two magnetic objects are connected, the plug can also transfer signals to the socket.

If the plug is not connected to a socket, the **`IN0`** signal will be sent to the alternative output, **`OUT1`**.

## Socket information
- **`IN0`**: Input signal
- **`OUT0`**: Status (is plug connected to socket?)
- **`OUT1`**: Alternative output
