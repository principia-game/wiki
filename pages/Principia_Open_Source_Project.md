The Principia Open Source Project is a colloquial term used for referring to the game's continued development as an open source project, originally announced in 2016 but later made into a reality in 2022.

The canonical source of the project is the [Bithack/principia repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Bithack/principia).

## History
In April of 2016, the front page of the official Principia community site was updated to announce that the game was going to be released as open source under the BSD 3-Clause license:

> **We're happy to announce that we have decided to open source Principia.**
>
> Instead of releasing it on Steam, It will be released on GitHub under a BSD 3-clause license free for anyone to study and modify. Stay tuned, follow @bithack on twitter.

At the time this was met with mixed reactions from the community, due to the community's previous support for getting Principia approved through Steam Greenlight in 2014 being made redundant as the Steam release of the game was officially cancelled. However the plans to release Principia's source code fell through at the time, while the announcement remained on the front page until the official community site's shutdown sometime early 2018.

Later in April of 2019, [[Apparatus 2019]] was announced as a Kickstarter project. While it beared the name of its predecessor, the game was planned to be based on the Principia codebase and was also going to be released as open source, making it effectively another attempt at further developing Principia as an open source project.

In August of 2022, the original creator of Principia joined an unofficial Discord server for Principia, and reestablished contact with the community after many years. After being overjoyed to see the game being still kept alive by the community, he promised to finally release the source code, and on the 6th of August 2022 the last revision of the game's source code from 2014 was pushed to the previously empty Principia repository on GitHub.
