Stores an internal value of the sum of all previous values read from **`IN0`**, minus all previous values read from **`IN1`**. The internal value is then divided by the maximum value and written to **`OUT0`** as a fraction.

This object can be used as a "health meter". Use **`IN1`** to decrement the health, and **`IN0`** to increment. Wire **`OUT0`** to a [[Ceil]] device and whenever the result is 0.0, all health is gone.

It can also be used for keeping track of a value between 1-20 (or even more with level hacking), as an alternative to the [[Switch]] for more than 5 switch branches. Simply calculate the fraction for each position as `position / Max value` and check against a [[Jumper]] of that value with a [[cmp-e]] or the like. See [32-bit Controllable Binary Counter](/level/8) for an example of this, which uses a hacked condenser that goes all the way up to 32.

## Socket information
- **`IN0`**: Increment
- **`IN1`**: Decrement
- **`OUT0`**: Fraction of stored internal value divided by Max value
