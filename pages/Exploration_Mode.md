Exploration Mode (previously just "Adventure mode") is a removed feature available in the play menu of Principia. In it you spawn in a random location in a procedurally generated adventure level controlling an adventure robot, and you explore the world, fighting other robots and collecting resources to construct things in your factory.

It was a remnant of the attempt to pivot Principia into a story-based adventure game around the end of the game's commercial development, and was never fully fleshed out.

In the open source version of Principia, the mode was renamed to Exploration mode in order to more accurately reflect its current state of rather aimless exploration, and its position in the play menu was downgraded putting the classic puzzle package at the top. It was later removed in 2025.04.05 in a rework of the play menu due to it reflecting poorly on the game for new players.

## Gameplay
The level you would spawn in was an entirely normal procedural adventure level, exactly like those that can be created in the sandbox. The terrain generation is the exact same given the same seed.

The following changes were also present, which you could recreate in the sandbox:

- The adventure robot had no body parts, expecting you to assemble it from parts found when killing other robots.
- You spawned with a [[Repair Station]] and a [[Factory]] next to you, which could end up at odd places depending on where your spawn area was.
