A plastic box with customisable colour fixed to the background wall. It can be used for brightly coloured wall decorations or for the creation of pixel art (See [[Making Pixel Art]]).

The Pixel's alpha channel is the frequency it listens on, and it changes its size after the value that is transmitted.
