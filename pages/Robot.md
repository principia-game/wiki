Light, hollow robot that can step on [[Command pad]] objects to receive commands. For puzzle levels, the level is completed if any robot steps on a [[Goal]]. Can be played in Adventure levels.

It can be configured and customised to give it a different body, head and many different weapons. By default a robot is equipped with the following in the sandbox:

- [[Arm Cannon]]
- [[Builder]]
- [[Zapper]]
- [[Compressor]]
- **Head equipment**: None
- **Head**: [[Robot head]]
- **Back equipment**: [[Robot back]]
- **Front equipment**: [[Robot front]]
- **Feet**: [[Feet]]
- **Bolt set**: [[Steel Bolt Set]]

In the procedurally generated adventure world, enemy robots spawn with random items and weapons that they may drop when killed. In adventure mode, a robot can be customised using the [[Repair Station]] if you feed the station new parts.

The special ability of the robot is becoming a box which makes it smaller and mitigates damage.
