A miniature version of the [[Transmitter]], that is only able to transmit signals over a single wireless frequency.

Multiple transmitters can be used on the same frequency, and the one sending a non-zero value will take precedent over the others. If multiple transmitters are transmitting non-zero values at the same time, the value actually transmitted is undefined.
