A wooden plank that can be placed in any of the 4 different sublayers of each layer. This feature has some useful properties. For example, attaching it to a motor will allow smaller objects to pass through the motor's anchor point in the same layer as the sublayer plank. This allows you to create rotating pipelines.

Regular planks can be attached by placing the in front of the sublayer plank.
