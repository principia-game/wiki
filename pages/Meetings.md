Development meetings are held when needed to discuss the development and future of the project.

Currently the meetings take place in text form online in `#development`, available on [Discord](/discord) as well as on [Matrix](/matrix). If there is no upcoming meeting planned at the moment then you can suggest one here.

Everyone is welcome to participate in the meetings, but some discussions may be of a more technical nature related to the game's development. Please stay on-topic and do not derail ongoing discussions.
